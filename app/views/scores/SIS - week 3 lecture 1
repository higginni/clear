Different ways of doing it 

What is outsourcing? 
Taking any role/job/part of organisation to give someone else 
Nike, Uber - Dont make shoes or own taxis 
A lot of businesses do not own or are not responsible for the principle assets 

Ronald Coase
Challeneged what constitutes a firm...

Dublin 
CIE, Guinness, ESB 
Not alone did the job they were there to do, they also ran everyhting to do with their staff and everything to do with it 

Trinity had its own printers when your one started 
Catering - owned, run and managed by college 
Gardeners 

The firm didnt just do the whole job, but they did all the support jobs as well - electricians, plumbers 
Wisdom was that was the right way to do that 

Definition 


Example: Catering in college being outsourced
Saves money, accountability, give someone else all that work to do. 
Experts on the subject

Part of competiton - it has changed 

CApabilities 
Advantages 

Early outsourcing 
- jobs were easy to do 
- Doesn't impact other jobs 
- Rest of the business can run quite easily 




Moving lorries may not be the same as running your network 

Trinity 
- Looking after the grounds 
- Maintenance and upkeep of building - no need to manage crafts people 
- Jobs to be done, when are they going to be done, how uch it will be done for --> hire someone to do this rather than manage people for all of this stuff
 
Outsource procurement 
More disruptive as its cross organisation, rather than one department 

Moving up the Value Chain 
ICT - outsourcing has become more sophisticated - ICT is much more commonly outsourced 
What makes the money and what adds the value 

Scale of UK public outcourcing 
Huge money 
Organisations whose business this is, money they can generate 
ICT/IS outsourcing early companies - IBM, HP - Work done off shore

Top Outsourced Functions

What are my core activities - What makes the money in our company 
Main job is selling 
R&D 
Marketing 
Sales 
Administration 

Legal, accounting, security, medical service etc doesn't need to be done by our company - we can focus on selling the shit we sell 


You don't give away all your knowledge .. but you apply standards and ensure you can measure the quality 

Still accountable - just managing other people to do it 

Nike -- 
500,000 less than 10% involved in the making of their product work for Nike 
A lot of the outsourcing companies are 100% committed to Nike 

Don't lose 100% of accountability eg fires in India in Zara factory

What to outsource?
-----------------

Nike
What will effect my ability to design and develop athletic footwear? 

Core of the business can survive if its done properly 

You name it, you can outsource it  
If you take something, look at all the steps - in say a supply chain - you can outsource a lot of the steps but still maintain control of your supply chain 

What is the core competence in ... 
Diageo - understanding the brand and marketing 
	- Mission statement - premium brands 
	- Aer Lingus/Ryanair - 

	- World leaders in Water - France,never recovered from reputational damage 


Understanding core competancy and then how important is ICT to that competency 

How important? 

IS operations 
Why would we outsource? 
IS operations 
Managing infrastructure, data centres, service desks - more easily outsourced than others  

1990's - big fashion (before .com boom) 
Kodak outsourced IS department 
Ran the function but didn't develop it 
Lost expertise 

Legacy systems - old systems given to other people to do 
Get best people to build new systems 

y2k - so much IS work meant a lot of outsourcing 

Best of breed - give help desk to one, datasource to another, end up outsourcing a load of people 

Business proces outsourcing 

One principle - never outsource a problem - Fix the problem, outsource the job.
